# Code Style Guidelines
- Write idiomatic Go code following [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).
- Prioritize simplicity and maintainability over premature optimization.
- Ensure proper error handling, returning meaningful errors.
- Prefer dependency injection to enhance testability and modularity.
- Maintain a consistent logging pattern using the `log` package.
- Use concurrent programming patterns safely with goroutines and sync primitives.
- Keep tests granular, each test should focus on a single function or behavior.
- Use table-driven tests for functions with multiple input/output cases.
- Run `gofmt` to maintain consistent formatting before committing code.
- Keep dependencies updated (`go mod tidy`).
- Only add comments where necessary, avoid redundant or obvious explanations.
- Document exported functions and types with Go doc comments.
- Keep README and inline documentation up-to-date.
- Do not commit binary files or build artifacts (`.gitignore` properly configured).
